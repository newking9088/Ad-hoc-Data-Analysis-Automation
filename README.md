# Ad-hoc-Data-Analysis-Automation
Use Python and SQL to automate data analysis by pulling data from AWS Redshift through a pipeline.

We use boto3 to pull data from AWS Redshift using Python and SQL. The pipeline leverages classes and Python tool functions to automate repeated ad-hoc tasks, including data processing, statistical analysis, visualization and report generation.
